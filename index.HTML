<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>As 2021 is drawing to an end, and the impact of the global
pandemic continues to be a weighty blow,
this is the second year the W3C community has not really seen each other.
Yet, we are meeting the needs of a Web which becomes
more and more useful to society. So,
please accept our great thanks for all you do,
and our very best wishes for the new year.</p>
